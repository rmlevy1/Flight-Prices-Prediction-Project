# Flight-Prices-Prediction-Project

This project was completed by Jigme Sherpa and Raam Levy.

In our project we set out to predict flight prices from Beijing to Shanghai and vice versa. 
We explored the following data sets(https://www.kaggle.com/lpisallerl/air-tickets-between-shanghai-and-beijing#sha-pek.csv) from kaggle, which contained prices of tickets purchased for flights from January 2019 to August 2019.
